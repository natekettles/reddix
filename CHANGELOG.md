## [Unreleased]
- Nothing yet.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-05-03
### Added
- Optional cookie authentication mode using `TOKEN_V2` and `REDDIT_SESSION` from an existing browser session.

### Fixed

## [0.2.9] - 2025-11-05
### Added
- Optional `ui.cell_width` and `ui.cell_height` overrides so you can pin custom terminal cell metrics when needed.
### Fixed

## [0.2.8] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Inline gallery support for multi-image posts with `,`/`.` cycling and action menu entries.
### Changed
- Gallery images now appear in the links browser so you can open originals directly from Reddix.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-10-29
### Changed
- `ui.theme = default` now follows your terminal colors out of the box.

## [0.2.6] - 2025-10-29
### Fixed
- Escape now exits the fullscreen media preview instead of quitting the app.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-10-17
### Added
- First-run release notes view that opens the latest highlights directly in the content pane and keeps them available from the guided menu.

## [0.2.4] - 2025-10-16
### Added
- Commenting workflow inside the Comments pane so `w` lets you write threads and replies without leaving Reddix.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-10-15
### Added
- Toggle to hide or reveal NSFW posts mid-session without leaving the feed.
### Changed
- Status bar and help copy now highlight the NSFW mode so the current setting is obvious.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-10-14
### Fixed
- Respect Reddit's hidden comment scores.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Inline previews now detect Kitty support at runtime, falling back to the legacy image placeholder while offering an external mpv launch when graphics are unavailable.
- Saving full-resolution media includes the original Reddit-hosted MP4 assets alongside images.
### Fixed
- Mouse capture is disabled on exit so terminals stop receiving stray pointer escape sequences after quitting.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-13
### Added
- Inline Kitty/mpv video playback for Reddit-hosted posts directly in the content pane, launched on demand from the actions menu with a configurable `REDDIX_MPV_PATH` override.
### Changed
- The actions menu now toggles inline video playback and reflects availability/status based on Kitty support and preview loading state.
- Inline previews reuse the same mpv session in loop mode so videos replay seamlessly without wiping the interface.

## [0.1.21] - 2025-10-10
### Fixed

## [0.1.19] - 2025-10-10
### Changed
- Always emit Kitty inline media previews so supported terminals render images instantly while others simply show empty space.
- Made the Kitty probe opt-in via `REDDIX_EXPERIMENTAL_KITTY_PROBE` to dodge glitchy terminals.

## [0.1.18] - 2025-10-10
### Fixed
- Prevented inline media previews from overflowing on very narrow terminals and rescaled them automatically when the viewport changes.

## [0.1.17] - 2025-10-09
### Added
- `?` help overlay with grouped keybindings and contextual sections.
### Changed
- Footer now shows only essential shortcuts and highlights `h/l` pane focus hints.

### Added
- Clipboard shortcut (`y`) copies the highlighted comment to the system clipboard.

## [0.1.15] - 2025-10-08
